                    <div class="image-content scroll text-white">This herbaceous, monocarpic plant, covered in brown or white spiny hairs, grows 30–60 cm tall. It boasts strap-shaped or linear-oblong basal leaves with wavy margins and bluish to purplish bowl-shaped flowers on short pedicels. Its habitat lies in high-altitude Himalayan areas (3800–4500 m), particularly in isolated regions near Nagula lake. Although rare, it was discovered in the Merak and Sakten region of Trashigang gewog and is strictly protected by the Monpa community in Tawang. Its distribution spans Eastern Bhutan, extending into India.</div>

It makes an increasing rosette of shortly hairy leaves, silvery grey, and when it gets to flowering size, sends up the tall stem, which is adorned with lovely pure white flowers, each with a most unusual and distinctive dark maroon stigma.</div>

The solitary flowering stem bears numerous pendulous yellow flowers, either single in the upper part or in groups of 2-6 in lower lateral cymes. Each flower has four yellow petals measuring 3-5cm. The ovary is densely hairy, with a stylus and a lobed stigma. Found at over 3200 m above sea level on the way towards Jomolhari base and Soe Yaksa.</div>

                    <div class="image-content scroll text-white">"Meconopsis horridula" is a monocarpic plant known for its diverse leaf shapes and arrangements. It produces solitary or clustered blue to reddish-blue flowers on bent stalks, creating a droopy appearance. Its basal leaves form a rosette, about 25 cm long, with spines and variations in shape, while upper leaves resemble bracts. The plant has straw-colored spines on stems and produces reniform dark brown seeds in spiny capsules upon maturity, marking the end of its lifecycle.In Bhutan it was found in Trashi Yangtse Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary.</div>
