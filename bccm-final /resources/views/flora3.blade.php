It is listed as one of the endemic species of rhododendron in Bhutan. It was spotted that species flowering precariously on the rocks and rocky soils on open hillsides at Kyitsugang at an altitude of 4,452 m above sea level.  A Scottish plant collector George Sherriff first sighted Rhododendron pogonophyllum at Tangchhu in 1937. </div>

The underside of the leaves have an attractive silvery to cinnamon indumentum and young growth is just stunning. Height 150cm in 10 years. Named after B.H. Hodgson, the former East India Company Resident in Nepal. The painting is by Walter Hood Fitch, based Joseph Dalton Hooker's field sketch.
