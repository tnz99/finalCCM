                        GNH originated in Bhutan in 1970s, when His Majesty the fourth king of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, identified GNH as a core value of the Bhutanese way of life. His Majesty said, "Gross national happiness is more important than gross domestic product." It was officially adopted as a national goal in 2008, and its principles have been enshrined in the country's constitution. GNH prioritizes the preservation of Bhutan's lush forests, clean rivers, and diverse wildlife. They set a target to maintain at least 60% forest cover and establish protected areas for wildlife. The third pillar of GNH is called "Conservation of the Environment." This pillar highlights the importance of protecting the environment as a core element of happiness and well-being. This way, GNH serves as an example of how a nation can prioritize both the happiness of its people and the health of the planet.

                        His Majesty has shown strong emphasis on addressing climate change in the country. During a visit by the Green Climate Fund delegation in 2018, His Majesty expressed the importance of using science and technology to combat the effects of climate change, which impact agriculture, water security, and community livelihood. GCF has approved substantial financial support for Bhutan, including capacity building, water adaptation planning, low-emission transport, and climate-resilient agriculture. To support Bhutan's ambitious climate goals, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is investing USD 26.6 million in the "Bhutan for Life" project, aimed at promoting nature and forest conservation to help the country remain carbon neutral. These efforts are part of Bhutan's comprehensive approach to addressing climate change and maintaining its unique commitment to gross national happiness.
